### New features

- Added PSF inference capabilities for generating broadband (polychromatic) PSFs from trained models given star positions and SEDs
- Introduced `PSFInferenceEngine` class to centralize training, simulation, metrics, and inference workflows
- Added `run_type` attribute to `DataHandler` supporting training, simulation, metrics, and inference modes
- Implemented `ZernikeInputsFactory` class for building `ZernikeInputs` instances based on run type
- Added `psf_model_loader.py` module for centralized model weights loading


### Bug fixes

- Fix logger formatting for relative RMSE metrics in `metrics.py` (values were not being displayed)

### Internal changes

- Refactored `TFPhysicalPolychromatic` and related modules to separate training vs. inference behavior
- Enhanced `ZernikeInputs` data class with intelligent assembly based on run type and available data
- Implemented hybrid loading pattern with eager loading in constructors and lazy-loading via property decorators
- Centralized PSF data extraction in `data_handler` module
- Improved code organization with new `tf_utils.py` module in `psf_models` sub-package
- Updated configuration handling to support inference workflows via `inference_config.yaml`
- Fixed incorrect argument name in `DataHandler` that prevented proper TensorFlow data type conversion
- Removed deprecated `get_obs_positions` method
- Updated documentation to include inference package
