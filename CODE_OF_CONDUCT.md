We, as members, contributors, and leaders of the WaveDiff community, pledge to foster an inclusive, respectful, and harassment-free environment for all participants, regardless of age, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, ethnicity, nationality, religion, or other protected characteristics.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to creating a positive and welcoming environment include:

- Showing empathy and kindness towards others.

- Giving and receiving constructive feedback graciously.
- Taking responsibility for our actions and learning from mistakes.
- Prioritizing the well-being and inclusivity of the entire community.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Personal attacks, trolling, or inflammatory remarks.
- Public or private harassment, including but not limited to, unwelcome advances or attention.
- Sharing others' private information without explicit consent.
- Any conduct that creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for upholding these standards of behavior and will address any instances of unacceptable conduct promptly and fairly. They have the authority to enforce the Code of Conduct by taking appropriate corrective action, including warnings, temporary bans, or permanent expulsion from the community.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all community spaces, including online forums, mailing lists, social media platforms, and official events or gatherings organized by WaveDiff.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at jennifer.pollack@cea.fr and sam.farrens@cea.fr. All reports will be reviewed and investigated thoroughly, and appropriate actions will be taken in response.

Community leaders are committed to respecting the privacy and confidentiality of individuals who report incidents and will handle each case with sensitivity and discretion.

## Enforcement Guidelines

In enforcing this Code of Conduct, community leaders will adhere to the following guidelines:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Behavior that is deemed inappropriate, unprofessional, or unwelcome.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A single incident or series of actions that violate community standards.

**Consequence**: A formal warning will be issued, outlining the consequences for continued misconduct. The individual will be restricted from interacting with the affected parties or community leaders for a specified period. Further violations may result in temporary or permanent bans.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: Serious or sustained violations of community standards.

**Consequence**: The individual will be temporarily banned from participating in community activities, including public communication or interaction with community members, for a designated period. Any attempts to circumvent this ban will result in immediate escalation to a permanent ban.
